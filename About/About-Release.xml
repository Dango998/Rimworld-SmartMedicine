	<description>Doctors will use medicine from their inventory. What a concept!
		
Doctors can also use medicine from the patient's inventory, or anyone else on the map, even pack animals brought on a caravan. 

An option to use cheaper medicine, if it will do just as well ( due to doctor skill, bionics, medical bed, etc. ) Note this doesn't affect surgery.

An option to use minimal medicine for non-urgent wounds, or none at all.

Now technically, the medicine is dropped and immediately picked back up - but what can you do.</description>
